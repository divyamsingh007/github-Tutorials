Here are some of my recommendations for your GitHub profile:

Keep the repository names lowercase and use hyphens to separate words e.g. todo-app instead of TodoApp or Todo-App.
Add a README.md file to each repository that you create. This file should contain a description of the project. Put some effort into the readme and make sure it clearly details what the project is about and how anyone can run it locally.
Add snapshots of your project to the readme file so that anyone can see what the project looks like without having to run it locally.
Add a LICENSE file to each repository that you create. This file should contain the license that you want to use for the project. You can use choosealicense.com to help you choose a license.
